💼 About Me
I’m a full-stack developer with a strong background in web and mobile development. I’ve been involved in several innovative projects, particularly in the IoT, banking, and energy sectors:

🏠 NEA SMART 2.0 — A smart home management app (available on Play Store and App Store) developed for the Rehau client. It allows users to control heating, air conditioning, and track environmental stats in real-time.

⚡ Coreso — Contributed to an energy management platform to collect, process, and visualize electricity data, supporting strategic decision-making for energy managers.

🏦 Oney Bank — Participated in the development of a batch export system for conversation analytics. The solution included multi-step processing (data collection, formatting, file generation) with robust architecture design (Factory Pattern, sequencing, and task parallelism). I also implemented log management and ensured data persistence between steps.
