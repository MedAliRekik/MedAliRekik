👋 Hello, I’m Ali Rekik  
💻 Full-Stack & Mobile Software Engineer (Java / Angular / Flutter)

I’m a full-stack engineer with 5+ years of experience building robust, secure and scalable applications in banking, energy, IoT and mobile.

I work end-to-end on projects: from requirements analysis and architecture design to implementation, CI/CD, monitoring and production support. I’m particularly comfortable with Java/Spring Boot on the back-end and Angular or Flutter on the front.

### 💼 What I’ve worked on

- 🏦 **Banking – Oney Bank**  
  Designed and developed a Spring Batch data pipeline and export system for contact-center analytics: REST data ingestion, complex business rules, file generation (Factory Pattern), performance tuning, logging and technical documentation.

- 🏠 **IoT – REHAU / Nea Smart 2.0**  
  Contributed to a smart heating & AC management app (available on the stores), working on microservices architecture, MQTT-based IoT communication, security (OAuth2), statistics and real-time monitoring.

- ⚡ **Energy – CORESO**  
  Back-end development for a strategic European energy coordination platform: microservices with Spring Boot, integration flows with Apache Camel, PostgreSQL, REST APIs and Agile collaboration with business teams.

- 🔐 **Mobile & Security – OnlyU (Goweb)**  
  Design and development of a secure secret-sharing mobile app with Flutter (MVC, Riverpod) and a modular .NET / REST backend. Implemented OAuth2/JWT authentication, Dockerized services and automated CI/CD with GitLab.
